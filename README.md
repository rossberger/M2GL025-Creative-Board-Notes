# M2GL025-Creative-Board-Notes

Some notes from tinkering with the Microsemi M2GL025 creative board.

[![Blue Board](/images/Microsemi_Board_IMG_9611_tn.jpg)](/images/Microsemi_Board_IMG_9611.jpg)
[![Yellow Board](/images/RISC-V_yellow_board_tn.png)](/images/RISC-V_yellow_board.png)

(Looks like it was originally done up in blue and got a new silkscreen job in 2017.  I don't see any changes to PCB routing or parts placement between the two).

## About the board

It's a USD$99 evaluation board from Microsemi that implements a RISC-V CPU system in a 25kLE IGLOO2 FPGA.

 * IGLOO2 M2GL025-VF256 flash-based FPGA
   * 256 KB eNVM (embedded non-volatile flash memory)
 * 64MB DDR2 SDRAM (Alliance AS4C32M16D2A-25BCN)
 * 8MB SPI flash (Microchip 26F064B)
 * 50MHz clock input
 * Integrated FT4232-based FlashPro5 USB JTAG adapter
 * Pin headers compatible with various popular hobbyist boards:
   * Arduino

## What tools do I need in order to program the board?

It depends what you mean by "program".  You can either program the FPGA or the CPU (assuming your FPGA design includes a soft CPU such as the RISC-V).

### FPGA Tools

In order to program the FPGA, you need to use Microsemi's Libero tool to synthesize a design and generate the FPGA programming files.  Once you've generated the programming files in Libero you use the FlashPro application to flash them into the target board's FPGA.  The FlashPro application comes with Libero.

### RISC-V CPU Tools

In order to program the CPU you need a compiler/linker/assembler toolchain.  For RISC-V that toolchain is [GCC](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc) (though folks are working on [LLVM](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-llvm)).

 * [RISC-V GCC](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc) is the primary compiler/linker/assembler/debugger toolchain.
 * [RISC-V OpenOCD](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-openocd) is an OpenOCD fork that supports RISC-V JTAG debug interface.
 * [GNU MCU Eclipse](https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/) is a family of Eclipse extensions for ARM and RISC-V development

You can either use the above tools directly or use a vendor-branded Eclipse-based IDE, such as:

 * [Microsemi SoftConsole](https://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/design-resources/design-software/softconsole#overview) Bundles Eclipse + GNU MCU extensions (OpenOCD and GCC) + some Microsemi-related examples.
 * [SiFive Freedom Fries Studio](https://www.sifive.com/products/tools/) is like SoftConsole but geared towards SiFive's product line.  Maybe you could get it to work with the SoftConsole projects mentioned on this page -- I haven't tried.

 If you're just getting started with the M2GL025 creative board then you probably want SoftConsole.

## What's the licensing deal?

 * **RISC-V core**: Freely available.  Note that there appear to be two RISC-V cores in the Microsemi DirectCore catalog (CoreRISCV_AXI4 and MiV_RV32) -- more on that below.  The license verbiage for the MiV_RV32 core sounds more permissive (["This core is being released under a modified Apache 2.0 license and is freely available through Libero"](http://www.actel.com/ipdocs/MiV_RV32IMA_L1_AHB_HB.pdf)).
 * **Libero**: The [Silver/Free license level](https://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/design-resources/licensing) can program devices up to 25k LEs, which matches the capacity of the M2GL025 IGLOO2 part.
 * **SoftConsole**: Free.  It's just Eclipse + MCU Eclipse extensions + GCC + OpenOCD in a bundle with some Microsemi-related examples.

However, IANAL and I'm not sure about the specifics of licensing for commercial applications.

## What's the difference between CoreRISCV_AXI4 and MiV_RV32 cores?

There are three RISC-V cores in Microsemi catalog:
* [RISC-V_AXI4](http://soc.microsemi.com/products/ip/search/detail.aspx?id=896)
* [MiV_RV32IMA_L1_AHB](http://soc.microsemi.com/products/ip/search/detail.aspx?id=903)
* [MiV_RV32IMAF_L1_AHB](http://soc.microsemi.com/products/ip/search/detail.aspx?id=904) "F is for single precision floating point" -- the documentation pdfs don't mention this fact, but the Libero catalog does:
  * ![miv_float](/images/miv_float.png)

According to Microsemi, "MiV core is the replacement for the original CoreRISCV_AIX4", and that they are "discontinuing the original core moving onto the Mi-V platform".

If you use the older AXI4 core, be aware that the HAL files produced by the Firmware Catalog differ for AXI4 and MiV cores.  The RISC-V HAL v2.0.104 is for the RISC-V_AXI4 core, while version >= 2.1.101 work with the MiV-RV32 cores, according to the HAL User Guide pdfs.

## Do I need to purchase a separate USB FlashPro programmer to use with the creative board?

No.  The board has an integrated FT4232-based USB FlashPro5 that works with the FlashPro application.  Signal-wise the integrated FlashPro connects to the IGLOO2 via standard JTAG -- it's just not detachable, and there is no JTAG header on the creative board.

If you use the creative board design as a basis for your own design, you could leave off the FT4232 parts and just bring out the normal JTAG signals on a header for use with a [regular FlashPro4/5](https://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/design-resources/programming/flashpro#ordering).

## Where can I get board schematics?

 * [Future Electronics](http://www.futureelectronics.com/en/campaign/microsemi/Pages/CreativeDevelopmentBoard.aspx).  Fill out the "Request Demo Projects" link, submit your information, and you'll get an email (<1min for me) with links to the board schematics and BOM in pdf format.

## What example projects are available as a starting point?

To get started with a RISC-V HDL design, a good starting place is [TU0775](https://www.microsemi.com/document-portal/doc_download/136945-tu0775-polarfire-fpga-building-a-mi-v-processor-subsystem-tutorial).  This is a fairly complete guide to building an Mi-V based system.  It's written with the PolarFire FPGA in mind, but generally applies to the IGLOO2 as well.  There are also a few ready-made example HDL projects listed below.

To get started developing RISC-V software with SoftConsole, the best way to get started is to use Firmware Catalog to generate an example SoftConsole 5.2 project.
  * Search for 'riscv' in Firmware Catalog
  * Right click the latest RISC-V HAL version
  * Select "Generate Sample Project", choose your project, and save the files to disk. ![GenSampleProject](/images/firm_cat_systick.png)
  * Open SoftConsole and choose File -> Import, Existing Projects into Workspace, and enter the directory of the files you generated above.

As for other Libero / SoftConsole project examples, below is a list of everything I could find online.  Note that most of these examples are for SoftConsole 5.1 and won't build under SoftConsole 5.2 unless you [migrate them](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/SoftConsole/#migrating-from-softconsole-v51-to-v52).  And they also use the older AXI4 core.

* At [this Future page](http://www.futureelectronics.com/en/campaign/microsemi/Pages/CreativeDevelopmentBoard.aspx) there are four (ok, three) projects available for download as .zip archives.
  * [Blinky LED](http://www.futureelectronics.com/en/manufacturers/microsemi/Documents/BlinkyIGLOO2.zip)
    * HDL-only Libero project.  No RISC-V core.  Includes pre-built programming files (.stp and .pro) so you can flash the FPGA with only [FlashPro Express](https://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/design-resources/programming/flashpro#software) if you don't want to rebuild everything in Libero.
  * [FLiR Thermal Imaging](http://www.futureelectronics.com/en/campaign/microsemi/PublishingImages/TVBLockDiagram.jpg)
    * It's just a link to a block diagram .jpg...
    * Here's [more information that still isn't a .zip file](http://ftm.futureelectronics.com/2017/03/future-electronics-flir-lepton-lwir-thermal-imaging-camera-demo-on-microsemi-igloo2-creative-board/).
  * [Hello World](http://www1.futureelectronics.com/mailing/Microsemi/IGL2_RISC-V_Hello_World.zip)
    * Includes one HDL project: IGL2_RISCV_Systick_Blinky and pre-built .stp programming file
    * Includes one SoftConsole project: IGL2_RISCV_Systick_Blinky (with "Alternate application file" main.c)
      * This project does not build when I import it into SoftConsole 5.2: ![HelloWorldBuild](/images/hello_world_build_fail.png)
  * [RISC-V Tic-tac-toe](http://www.futureelectronics.com/en/manufacturers/microsemi/Documents/TicTacToe%20Demo.zip)
    * Includes two Libero HDL projects (and pre-built programming files): CoreRISCV_AXI4_BaseDesign and IGL2_CoreRISCV_AXI4_TickTacToe
    * Includes two SoftConsole projects: riscv-systick-blinky and TickTackToe
      * Has same issue as Hello World above: projects are for SoftConsole 5.1 and need to be migrated to 5.2.

* https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/M2GL025-Creative-Board
  * Includes two Libero HDL projects (and pre-built programming files): CoreRISCV_AXI4_BaseDesign and IGL2_CoreRISCV_AXI4_TickTacToe
  * Includes two SoftConsole 5.1 projects: riscv-systick-blinky and TickTackToe
  * YellowBoard directory contains the factory-programmed HDL and firmware (Systick_Blinky) and uses the CoreRISCV_AXI4 core.  Programming files are also included.
  * None of the SoftConsole projects will build in 5.2 without [migrating them](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/SoftConsole/#migrating-from-softconsole-v51-to-v52).

* https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/uCOS
  * Includes one SoftConsole 5.1 project: blinky (needs migration to 5.2 in order to build)
  * Includes riscv-uCOS-sample: This is a port of Micrium's uC/OS-II RTOS to RISC-V.
    * DOES build under SoftConsole 5.2 - but only the Debug target.  So it's possible to load into RAM and run with OpenOCD.  The Release target isn't properly configured.

* https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/SoftConsole/
  * Very useful bits of information about generating SoftConsole project templates from Firmware Catalog and migrating from SoftConsole 5.1 to 5.2.

## What are the HAL files and where do they come from?

For many cores in their IP catalog, Microsemi provides low-level hardware abstraction libraries (perhaps more aptly called a BSP) that expose a C API for the core's functionality.  You can generate these HAL files from the [Firmware Catalog](https://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/design-resources/design-software/firmware-catalog) application, which is installed by default with Libero.

For example, for a design that uses the Microsemi RISC-V core, you'd search in Firmware Catalog for 'risc' and select "Generate...".  This will make the tool spit out the C/asm files that you can include in your SoftConsole/gcc project.  Repeat as needed for any additional cores (e.g., SPI).

![riscvHAL](/images/firm_cat_riscv.png)

Firmware Catalog can also be used to generate RISC-V SoftConsole project templates (which include the above HAL files).

![GenSampleProject](/images/firm_cat_systick.png)

**NOTE**: The RISC-V HAL v2.0.104 is to be used with the RISC-V_AXI4 core, while version >= 2.1.101 work with the MiV-RV32 cores, according to the HAL User Guide pdfs.

**NOTE2**: The RISC-V HAL files are duplicated at https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/riscv-hal.  This is the same riscv-HAL you would normally generate using the Firmware Catalog application and it's probably best to get them from the catalog instead.

## How do I restore the original as-shipped FPGA bitfile onto the board?

HDL sources and pre-built FPGA programming files corresponding to the as-shipped design (Systick_Blinky) can be found in the [YellowBoard folder of the M2GL025-Creative-Board repo](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/M2GL025-Creative-Board/tree/master/YellowBoard/).  Use the FlashPro application to program the [.stp file](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/M2GL025-Creative-Board/blob/master/YellowBoard/Programming%20the%20Target%20Device/PROC_SUBSYSTEM.stp).

## How do I restore the original as-shipped RISC-V CPU firmware onto the board?

The CPU firmware is not stored in the 26F064B serial flash part as you might think -- it's flashed into the IGLOO2's eNVM memory instead.  This is done at the same time the FPGA fabric is flashed with FlashPro.

Sources and binaries for the as-shipped firmware are [here](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/M2GL025-Creative-Board/tree/master/YellowBoard/Software%20project/IGL2_RISCV_Systick_Blinky).

So the short answer is that the as-shipped firmware is restored when you use FlashPro to program the YellowBoard [.stp file](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/M2GL025-Creative-Board/blob/master/YellowBoard/Programming%20the%20Target%20Device/PROC_SUBSYSTEM.stp) mentioned above.

## How do I load new CPU firmware so that it runs at power up?

1. Setup a SoftConsole 5.2 project with your software.
2. Build the Release target.  This will use a linker command file that links the code at 0x6000_0000 (eNVM base) as opposed to RAM base 0x8000_0000.  If you use Firmware Catalog to generate your SoftConsole project template, the Release target uses the microsemi-riscv-igloo2.ld linker file.  The build result is a .hex file.
3. In Libero, double-click "Update eNVM Memory Content" in the Design Flow tab: ![eNVM0](/images/envm_update_00.png)
  * You'll be presented with this dialog: ![eNVM1](/images/envm_update_01.png)
  * Select the data storage region and click Edit to choose the .hex file you just built in SoftConsole: ![eNVM1](/images/envm_update_02.png)
3. Generate the programming files in Libero and program the target with FlashPro as usual.

## What is the initial program counter / reset vector for the RISC-V CPU?

The [privileged ISA](blob:https://riscv.org/ab5ac531-378c-4f43-ba5c-1baf025519a6) (section 3.3) says reset vector is implementation specific.

Looking at our specific implementation then, the [CoreRISCV_AXI4 core user manual](http://www.actel.com/ipdocs/CoreRISCV_AXI4_HB.pdf) (section 5.1.1) says default `RESET_VECTOR_ADDR` is `0x6000_0000`, and the example projects [show it configured that way](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/M2GL025-Creative-Board/blob/master/Modify_The_FPGA_Design/CoreRISCV_AXI4_BaseDesign/component/work/PROC_SUBSYSTEM/CORERISCV_AXI4_0/rtl/vlog/core/coreriscv_axi4.v#L153):

```verilog
parameter RESET_VECTOR_ADDR = 60000000;
```

As described in the firmware programming section above, `0x6000_0000` is the base address of the eNVM memory in the IGLOO2 and is the location of \_start/.text when using the [Linker_Run_from_NVM.lds](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/M2GL025-Creative-Board/blob/master/YellowBoard/Software%20project/IGL2_RISCV_Systick_Blinky/Linker_Run_from_NVM.lds) linker command file.  So it makes a sense as the reset vector!

## Is the IGLOO2 eNVM memory base address configurable?
According to [UG0448](https://www.microsemi.com/document-portal/doc_download/132009-ug0448-igloo2-fpga-high-performance-memory-subsystem-user-guide) (sections 2.2, 4.1.4)... I'm not sure.  But it doesn't look like it.  Maybe you can configure the AHB bus matrix.  I didn't go that deep.

There's some related information about doing an initial copy from eNVM to SRAM in [AC421](https://www.microsemi.com/document-portal/doc_view/133704-ac421-igloo2-fpga-sram-initialization-from-envm-libero-soc-v11-7-application-note).  It doesn't apply to the creative board though.

## Where is the eNVM component located in the Libero design?

You have to drill down:
* PROC_SUBSYSTEM
  * HPMS_0_sb
    * HPMS_0_sb_HPMS ![HPMS_0_sb_HPMS](/images/hpms_envm.png)

Double-clicking the ENVM component will take you into the same "Update eNVM Memory Content" dialog as the Design Flow tab.  This allows you to specify which firmware .hex file to flash into the IGLOO2.  (Make sure the firmware is built using the Release target in SoftConsole, so that it's linked at 0x6000_0000, the eNVM base address).

## What is the memory map of the Creative Board?
It depends on the specific HDL implementation, but for the factory default FPGA load (Systick_Blinky), it's given here:

* [README.txt](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/M2GL025-Creative-Board/blob/master/YellowBoard/FPGA%20Design/IGL2_RISCV_Systick_Blinky/README.txt)

I think that comes from an output of Libero... maybe [subsystem.bfm](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/M2GL025-Creative-Board/blob/master/YellowBoard/FPGA%20Design/IGL2_RISCV_Systick_Blinky/component/work/PROC_SUBSYSTEM/subsystem.bfm)?

That's the hardware memory map.  If you're just talking about the linker sections you can look at:
* [Linker command file](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/M2GL025-Creative-Board/blob/master/YellowBoard/Software%20project/IGL2_RISCV_Systick_Blinky/Linker_Run_from_NVM.lds)
* [.lst file](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/M2GL025-Creative-Board/blob/master/YellowBoard/Software%20project/IGL2_RISCV_Systick_Blinky/Release/IGL2_RISCV_Systick_Blinky.lst)
* [.map file](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/M2GL025-Creative-Board/blob/master/YellowBoard/Software%20project/IGL2_RISCV_Systick_Blinky/Release/IGL2_RISCV_Systick_Blinky.map)

Or (in Linux), use `readelf -a file.elf`:

```
$ readelf -a miv-rv32ima-systick-blinky.elf
 ...

```

## How does the external serial flash / SPI memory get loaded into RAM?
It doesn't, at least not in the default design.  An SPI core is only instantiated in some of the example designs (e.g., [TicTacToe](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/M2GL025-Creative-Board/tree/master/Modify_The_FPGA_Design/IGL2_CoreRISCV_AXI4_TickTacToe)).  The default program is stored in the eNVM region of the IGLOO2, not the serial flash.  See eNVM discussion above.

If you want to read/write the serial flash part:
1. Make sure CORESPI is appropriately instantiated in your Libero project
2. Generate and include the SPI HAL files in your SoftConsole project
3. Write application code that uses the SPI HAL API.  A starting place might be the [baremetal bootloader](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/SoftConsole/tree/master/riscv-simple-baremetal-bootloader). (Note that this particular project doesn't run on the YellowBoard with the default FPGA bitfile.)

## Simulation

There are a few simulators to choose from.  Here are two.  Some others are listed [here](https://riscv.org/software-status/#simulators).
1. [Spike](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-sim) This is the RISC-V ISA reference simulator
2. [Qemu](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-qemu/issues) A Qemu fork for RISC-V.

### What is pk?

https://github.com/riscv/riscv-pk

Per https://riscv.org/software-tools/ (and [this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28842732)), RISC-V PK is a proxy kernel that services system calls generated by code built and linked against the RISC-V Newlib port (this does not apply to Linux, as it handles the system calls).  pk should only be used when you want to simulate an application that uses such system calls.

### What is the reset vector for qemu and spike simulators?
It's the same for both, as described here: https://github.com/slavaim/riscv-notes/blob/master/bbl/boot.md
* reset vector: 0x1000
* memory base: 0x80000000

There are two instructions at 0x1000, hard-coded into qemu, that do a jump to 0x80000000.  So the effective initial PC (and the location your code should be linked to for simulation) is 0x80000000.

### Can I change qemu's RISC-V reset vector?
No, it's hard-coded.  See above.

### How do I set the program counter manually (in gdb)?
`(gdb) set $pc = 0x80000000`

### How do I simulate the M2GL025 Creative Board examples?

You can simulate the examples in qemu as long as they don't use memory mapped IO at locations qemu doesn't know about.

1. Use Firmware Catalog to create an example SoftConsole project
2. Comment out any code that would access MMIO regions qemu doesn't know about.  E.g., from the systick-blinky example:
```
//    PLIC_init();
//    GPIO_init(&g_gpio_in, COREGPIO_IN_BASE_ADDR, GPIO_APB_32_BITS_BUS);
//    GPIO_init(&g_gpio_out, COREGPIO_OUT_BASE_ADDR, GPIO_APB_32_BITS_BUS);
//    UART_init(&g_uart,
//              COREUARTAPB0_BASE_ADDR,
//              BAUD_VALUE_115200,
//              (DATA_8_BITS | NO_PARITY));
//
//    UART_polled_tx_string(&g_uart, (const uint8_t *)g_hello_msg);
//    SysTick_Config(SYS_CLK_FREQ);
```
3. Build the Debug target so that the resulting .elf file is linked at 0x8000_0000.
4. Invoke qemu:
```
./qemu-system-riscv32 -S -s -kernel ~/tmp/riscv-tools/miv-rv32ima-systick-blinky.elf -nographic
```
  * `-S              freeze CPU at startup (use 'c' to start execution)`
  * `-s              shorthand for -gdb tcp::1234` -- Starts gdb server on localhost:1234

Optionally add `-d cpu,exec` if you'd like qemu to dump debug info as the program executes.

5. In another console:
```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb miv-rv32ima-systick-blinky.elf
(gdb) target remote localhost:1234
```
Alternatively, you could use [gdbgui](https://github.com/cs01/gdbgui):
```
gdbgui -r -n -g /path/to/riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb miv-rv32ima-systick-blinky.elf
```

qemu currently emulates the following risc-v "boards", which are specified with the `-machine` option (use `$ ./qemu-system-riscv32 -machine help` to get a list):
* SiFive e300 `-machine sifive_e300` ([memory map](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-qemu/blob/e7cac973771829a8c49f0069a7884ef8d4310bd8/hw/riscv/sifive_e300.c#L59))
* SiFive u500 `-machine sifive_u500` ([memory map](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-qemu/blob/e7cac973771829a8c49f0069a7884ef8d4310bd8/hw/riscv/sifive_u500.c#L56))

If your program accesses memory outside your board's memory regions, qemu will exit abruptly with an error similar to:
```
    unassigned address not implemented for riscv
    are you trying to fetch instructions from an MMIO page?
    unassigned Address: 00000000fffffff8
```
